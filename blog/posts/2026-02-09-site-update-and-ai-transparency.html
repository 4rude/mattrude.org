                <p>A few changes to share with this update.</p>

                <h3>A New Look</h3>

                <p>I asked <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-6-system-card" target="_blank">Claude</a> for three design update versions, chose a cool sounding one, then went through four iterations until it looked more like a tree at the end of fall.</p>

                <h3>Removing Annotations</h3>

                <p>I've removed the annotations section from the site. It was a fun idea, but I'm not going to explore it further. Personally, I think the energy is better spent on trying, failing, and learning.</p>

                <h3>On AI and Transparency</h3>

                <p>This website was built and updated with the help of Claude. That includes code, styling, content structure, and this post. Every step involves human direction, review, and editing; nothing goes live without my sign-off. I'd recommend the same level of care (or hopefully, more) to others.</p>

                <p>AI tools are powerful, and like any powerful tool, they deserve thoughtful use. CERN recently published their <a href="https://home.cern/news/official-news/knowledge-sharing/general-principles-use-ai-cern" target="_blank">General Principles for the Use of AI</a>, and I think they provide a strong framework that extends well beyond particle physics. Their principles include:</p>

                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Transparency and explainability:</strong> Document and communicate when and how AI is used.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsibility and accountability:</strong> Human oversight must remain paramount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human oversight:</strong> AI use must always remain under human control, with outputs consistently validated by a human.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security and safety:</strong> Protect systems from cybersecurity threats while maintaining integrity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Assess environmental and social impacts.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I'm committing to follow these principles on this site and in my work going forward. In practice, that means:</p>

                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Being transparent when AI tools are used in creating content or code.</li>
                    <li>Every piece of AI-generated output is reviewed, tested, and edited by me before it goes live.</li>
                    <li>I take full responsibility for everything published here, regardless of what tools were used to help create it.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This isn't about being against AI. I think AI-assisted learning and development is some of the most exciting modern technologies to emerge. But accessibility and transparency go hand in hand.</p>

                <h3>What's Next</h3>

                <p>I started at Nagios as a Technical Sales Representative back in June 2025, and I'm enjoying the work and the culture. The core mission hasn't changed: making powerful technology accessible to everyone.</p>

                <p>Thanks for reading.</p>

                <p>— Matt</p>

                <p>In <a href="/blog/posts/2025-03-25-launching-my-personal-website.html">my previous post</a>, I mentioned how today's website costs a fraction of what similar technology would have cost in the past. This dramatic decrease in cost isn't just limited to my personal website — it's part of a broader trend in technology that has profound implications for creators, small businesses, and organizations of all sizes.</p>
                
                <p>Let's break down why tech infrastructure is more affordable and accessible than ever before, and what this means for the future of innovation.</p>
                
                <h3>The Plummeting Cost of Web Hosting</h3>
                
                <p>One of the most revealing ways to examine this trend is to look at web hosting costs over time. While raw hosting prices have remained relatively stable, what you get for your money has increased exponentially — and storage capacity provides the clearest illustration of this revolution in technology value.</p>

                            <h5>Technical Notes</h5>
                            <p><sup>1</sup> Liquid Web has shifted from shared hosting to VPS (Virtual Private Server) offerings. A VPS is like having your own small dedicated computer in the cloud, giving you more control and resources than shared hosting.</p>
                            <p><sup>2</sup> For reference, 1000 MB (megabytes) = 1 GB (gigabyte).</p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Within decades, storage capacity has exploded while prices have remained stable or even decreased. Monthly prices stayed relatively consistent ($9.95-$24.95) throughout this 27-year period, making these storage increases even more remarkable.</p>
                
                <div style="text-align: center; margin: 50px 0; font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic; color: #333;">
                    "The hosting industry has clearly benefitted from the huge advances in hard drive technology (and of course much cheaper hard drives in general)."
                    <div style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 15px;">— <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/web-hosting-now-vs-10-years-ago/" target="_blank">Pingdom (2008)</a></div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Pingdom recognized this trend because the underlying technology for storage consistently improved, enabling massive increases in hard drive capacity and performance while costs continued to drop.</p>
                <p>This pattern mirrors a famous observation in the tech world called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Learn more about Moore's Law on Wikipedia (opens in new tab)">Moore's Law</a>, which highlights how computing components have historically become significantly more powerful and less expensive roughly every couple of years, driving innovation across the entire industry.</p>
                
                <p>To fully grasp how technology has become democratized, we need to zoom out and witness the historic collapse of computing costs that's made all of this innovation possible.</p>

                <h3>Why This Matters for Everyone</h3>
                
                <p>The implications of this steep cost reduction go beyond getting more bang for your buck. This trend has transformed <i>who</i> can afford to participate in the web:</p>
                
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Individual creators can now host multi-media content without relying on Big Tech</li>
                    <li>Small businesses can run their own high-end software on modest budgets</li>
                    <li>Non-profits and community organizations can communicate online regardless of funding</li>
                    <li>Students and hobbyists can experiment and learn using real-world tools</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>What we're witnessing is nothing less than the democratization of technology. Services that were once only available to large corporations with substantial IT budgets are now accessible to nearly everyone (note: my perspective is limited to the services available in the USA).</p>
                
                <div class="personal-experience card card-accent-left">
                    <h4>My Personal Experience</h4>
                    <p>I've directly benefited from this technology cost reduction: this very website's domain costs less than $8/year, was developed with the assistance of a $20/month Claude Pro subscription, and is hosted completely free using Cloudflare Pages.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h3>The Future: Even Greater Accessibility</h3>
                
                <p>This trend shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, new developments continue to emerge that further reduce barriers to entry:</p>
                
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>The open source movement democratizing access to modern technology</li>
                    <li>AI-assisted development tools that reduce the technical expertise required</li>
                </ul>
